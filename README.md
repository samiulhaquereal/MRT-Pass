MRTPass is a Flutter-based application designed to enhance your MRT card experience. With MRTPass, you can:

1. Quickly Check Your MRT Card Balance: Scan your MRT card to instantly view your current balance and recent transactions.
2. Fare Calculation Made Easy: Calculate fares between stations and determine how many round trips your current balance can cover.

The application is built with BLoC (Business Logic Component) for state management, adhering to SOLID principles to ensure clean and scalable architecture.

This project draws inspiration from MRT Buddy, an innovative app by Ani Adhikary and his team, originally developed using Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP). I reimagined the concept with Flutter, bringing the functionality to a broader audience with cross-platform support.
